# Build Guide for KYC Sentinel Package

This guide provides steps to generate an executable (.exe) file from the `main.py` script using PyInstaller.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install PyInstaller if you haven't already:
  
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```

## Steps to Create Executable
1. **Open Command Prompt** (or terminal).
2. **Navigate to the directory** where `main.py` is located:
   
   ```bash
   cd path\to\KYC_Sentinel_Package
   ```

3. **Run PyInstaller** with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile main.py
   ```

   - The `--onefile` flag packages everything into a single executable.

4. **Locate the executable**:
   - After the build process is complete, navigate to the `dist` folder created in the same directory.
   - Your `.exe` file will be located there.

5. **Test the executable**:
   - You can now run the executable directly by double-clicking it in the `dist` folder.

## Additional Notes
- You may want to customize the PyInstaller command with additional flags depending on your needs.
- Refer to the [PyInstaller documentation](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more options.
